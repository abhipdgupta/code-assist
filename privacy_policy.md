# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to Code-Assist! This extension is designed to help you find videos of LeetCode problems, save questions, and download PDFs of your notes. We value your privacy and strive to protect your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Remote Code Usage

- **jsPDF Library**: Our extension uses the jsPDF library to generate PDF files. This library includes some remote code to provide its functionality. No user data is transmitted to external servers by this library.

### User Data

- **YouTube API Key**: Code-Assist uses a YouTube API key provided by the user to search for relevant videos. This key is stored securely using encryption and is only used for its intended purpose. No other personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted.

### Permissions

- **Active Tab**: This permission allows the extension to access the URL of the currently active tab when the extension is activated by the user. This is necessary to provide relevant functionality based on the page you are visiting (e.g., LeetCode problems).
- **Storage**: This permission allows the extension to use the Chrome storage API to store user preferences and other necessary data locally. This includes saving your YouTube API key securely.
- **Unlimited Storage**: This permission grants the extension unlimited storage capacity to store large amounts of data if needed. However, we only store data necessary for the functionality of the extension.
- **Scripting**: This permission allows the extension to inject scripts into web pages to interact with them. The scripts are only used to enhance the functionality of the extension and do not collect or transmit user data.

## Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. The YouTube API key you provide is encrypted and stored securely using the Chrome storage API. We do not access, collect, or transmit any other personal data.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with any third parties. The jsPDF library used in the extension operates locally within your browser and does not transmit data to any external servers.

## User Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: You can request access to the data we have stored (YouTube API key).
- **Deletion**: You can request the deletion of your stored YouTube API key at any time.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at abhipdgupta007@gmail.com.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and you will be notified of any significant changes.
